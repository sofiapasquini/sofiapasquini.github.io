title: "Probing Evolution of Carbonaceous Molecules Using Clustering Analyses"
collection: portfolio
---

An exploration of the efficacy of clustering analyses on astronomical data (with observations from Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes) I perform for my M.S.c research. I hope to understand the mechnism of the evolution of stable, carbonaceous molecules in high-energy star-forming regions by analyzing key stratifications in emission properties from these molecules on various spatial and wavelength scales.
