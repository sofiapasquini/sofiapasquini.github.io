title: "Numerical Simulation to Solve Lane-Emden Equation."
collection: portfolio

I use a system of ordinary differential equations and a second-order Runge-Kutta integration scheme in order to numerically simulate the physical equation of state describing the interior structure of a stellar body. I solve the Lane-Emden equation for the solutions of order n=1.5, 3, 3.5, though this value can be altered to higher dimension for further exploration.
