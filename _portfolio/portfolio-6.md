title: "Python ETL Package- SpecFetch23"
collection: portfolio
---

This repository contains a published Python package of my own creation which acts as an ETL pipeline that cleans and serves energy distribution data for any given object from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database queried by the user using the object's Celestial Coordinates (right ascension and declination). Though this package uses the celestial coordinates and SDSS database to query for data, these parameters can be easily varied in future releases.
