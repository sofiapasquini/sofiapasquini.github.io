A deep learning, neural network classifier constructed using the Keras framework. Model hyperparameters were trained/optimized using a 5-fold cross-validation grid search appraoch in order to be able to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database. Leveraged the visualization capabilities of TensorBoard in order to visualize the training process. [Click here]([https://github.com/sofiapasquini/Keras-DL-Classification]) to see this repository.
