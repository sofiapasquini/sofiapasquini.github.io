I am a Master of Science student at the University of Western Ontario in the Astronomy program with a focus on Machine Learning. In my research, I am interested in exploring the diagnostic capabilities of unsupervised machine learning techniques on astronomical observations. Specifically, I am working as a part of the ERS collaboration, using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope to probe the photo-chemical evolution of carbonaceous molecules in the Orion Bar.  These results will shed light on scales out of reach of current state-of-the-art telescopes, eliminating the need for expensive observations and potentially leading to the identification of the mechanism for the observed photochemical evolution of these carbonaceous molecules. Outside of research, I am keen to experiement with deep learning frameworks to solve real-world problems.


I am passionate about intentional living, adventure, wellness and all things fitness! In my spare time you can find me clocking in serious time on my yoga mat or binge-reading a thriller novel. I love to spend time with my family and to be outdoors whenever possible.
