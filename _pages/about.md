I am a Master of Science student at the University of Western Ontario in the Astronomy program with a focus on Machine Learning. In my research, I am interested in exploring the diagnostic capabilities of unsupervised machine learning techniques on astronomical observations. Specifically, I am working as a part of the ERS collaboration, using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope to probe the photo-chemical evolution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in the Orion Bar. As these molecules are ubiquitous in space and control the physical conditions of their local environments, they play an important role in the large-scale evolution of galaxies and star-formation regions. I hope to use the power of machine learning to push the bounds of current knowledge in this area of astrochemistry. Outside of research, I am keen to experiement with deep learning frameworks to solve real-world problems.

I am using a combination of Divisive and K-Means clustering algorithms, as well as exploring a modified supervised Random Forest Classifier in this application, to probe changes in particle emission so as to identify stratification between physical parameters describing extreme astrophysical environmental conditions. These results will shed light on scales out of reach of current state-of-the-art telescopes, eliminating the need for expensive observations and potentially leading to the identification of the mechanism for the observed photochemical evolution of these carbonaceous molecules.

I am passionate about intentional living, adventure, wellness and all things fitness. In my spare time you can find me clocking in serious time on my yoga mat or binge-reading a thriller novel.
